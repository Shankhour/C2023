       <center>this is our project for PLTW 3.2.4 in which we researched honey and expirmented with how to code graphs
	       and analytical data.</center> </p>

 <p style="font-family: sans-serif;"></p>
       <center>This is my minion simulator! we created a game in which you can customize
	       a minion and the way it works is it you ask if its evil or good (yellow or purple), 
	       then you can customize its features. We had the code create the minion and its features using shapes!</center> </p>

    <p style="font-family: sans-serif;"></p>
       <center>Our 4.1.4 project we used Netlogo to investigate Erosion and how it simulates in soil. there are many factors
	       that affect it such as hill, bumpy, amount of rainfall, amount of soil hardness, and terrain smoothness. You can also hide or show the water.
	       we concluded thatWater flows to the adjacent patch where the water level is lowest, as long as that patch is lower than the source.
	       The amount of flow is proportional to the difference in level, so that the water level on the two patches is (if possible) equalized.

	       
    <h1> 3.1.6 project!</h1>

      <img src="Images/rover project.JPG" class="center" height="400">
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif;"></p>
       <center>This is our 3.1.6 project. what our task is, is to find which planet or plain the rover landed on. they provide information and with the information 
	       provided we needed to create graphs and see which graph best matches where the rover landed. we concluded that the possible landing point for the rover is the Desert Plains because
	       the data matches up directly.
